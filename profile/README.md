# ðŸ¤– Project Sentry 

Welcome to **Project Sentry**â€”an advanced automated security system designed to integrate cutting-edge computer vision, real-time event detection, and vehicle control for comprehensive security management.

## Overview

**Project Sentry** is a robust security solution composed of several key components, each playing a critical role in maintaining and enhancing security:

### 1. Computer Vision Application

Our Computer Vision Application utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) engine algorithm to provide real-time object detection and identification. This sophisticated vision system enables accurate and fast recognition of objects within camera feeds, serving as the backbone for our security monitoring.

### 2. Event Detection App

The Event Detection App processes the camera feeds received from the Computer Vision Application to monitor for specific security events. By defining and detecting critical events based on predefined criteria, the system can trigger alerts and notifications to users, ensuring rapid responses to potential security breaches.

### 3. Platform Control Application

The Platform Control Application functions as the central hub for managing and controlling security vehicles. Through this application, users can direct Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to specified locations, monitor their status in real-time, and manage their operations. This application integrates with other components to provide a unified security management interface.

### 4. Vehicle (AGV)

The Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) is a vital component of the Project Sentry system, equipped with advanced technologies for enhanced navigation and object avoidance:

- **LiDAR:** Utilized for object detection and avoidance, ensuring safe and efficient movement in various environments.
- **RTK (Real-Time Kinematic):** Enhances GPS accuracy for high-precision positioning, critical for accurate navigation and operation.

The AGVâ€™s movements and tasks are automated and managed through the Platform Control Application, enabling efficient and effective security operations.
